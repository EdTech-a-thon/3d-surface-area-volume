       floating window is resized by hand, to anything, and a breakpoint meant
       for phones would drop the controls to their own line in a window with

       One panel is usually the wider, so when the middle of the window is out
       of reach the controls settle for the middle of the gap instead; only when
       even that is gone do they take a line of their own underneath. Below
